# Project Utility Scripts

This directory contains general-purpose Python utility scripts for the project.

## Adding New Scripts

- Place your script directly in this `utils/` directory.
- Ensure your script has a clear purpose and is well-documented.
- If your script has external dependencies, please document them clearly, either in the script's docstring or in this README.
